# Music Generation Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a **music generation model** built using **Deep Learning** techniques. The model processes **MIDI files**, learns musical patterns using an **LSTM neural network**, and generates new musical compositions.

## 🚀 Features
- **MIDI File Processing:** Uses `music21` to extract and preprocess musical notes.
- **LSTM Model:** Implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers.
- **Data Handling:** Parses MIDI files, extracts sequences, and encodes them for training.
- **Music Generation:** Trains on MIDI datasets and generates new compositions.

## 📌 Use Cases
1. **AI-Generated Music:** Create original compositions based on learned musical patterns.
2. **Music Data Analysis:** Study musical structures and extract meaningful features.
3. **Creative Assistance:** Assist musicians in generating new ideas and compositions.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Abdus-Sami01/Music-Generation-using-LSTM.git
cd music-generation-using-deep-learning
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download necessary NLP resources:**
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

4. **Ensure you have the required deep learning framework installed:**
```sh
pip install tensorflow torch keras music21 numpy
```

## 🛠️ Usage
Open and run the `music-generation-using-deep-learning.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
2. Open `music-generation-using-deep-learning.ipynb` and execute the cells to train and generate music.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Loads MIDI files and extracts musical notes.
2. **Preprocessing:** Converts notes into numerical sequences.
3. **Model Training:** Trains an LSTM-based neural network to learn musical patterns.
4. **Music Generation:** Predicts and generates new sequences based on trained data.
