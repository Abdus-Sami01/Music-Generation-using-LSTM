# Music-Generation-using-LSTM
This project uses deep learning to generate music by analyzing MIDI files and learning musical patterns with an LSTM-based neural network. It processes notes using music21, trains on sequences, and creates original compositions using TensorFlow and Keras. Ideal for AI-powered music composition and creative assistance. ðŸŽµðŸš€
